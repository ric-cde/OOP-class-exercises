# Write a class to represent  a car â€“ each car has reg number, make, engine size and four wheels.
# Each wheel has tread depth. A car is safe is the tread depth of each four wheels is at least 1.6mm.
# A Garage may have several cars. Add functionality that alerts the garage which cars need their wheels replaced.
